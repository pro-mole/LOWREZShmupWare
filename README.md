# FLASH SHMUP

## Submission for *LOW REZ JAM 2016*, a 64x64 pixel game jam

**FLASH SHMUP** is a shoot'em up game similar to Space Invaders or Galaga, with a fast paced mission based flow. It's like classic shooter gameplay crossed with frantic WarioWare style prompts, randomized spawns and a mild variety of enemies with different flight and shoot patterns.
